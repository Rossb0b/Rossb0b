# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is [Nicolas Hallaert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-hallaert/) and I'm mainly doing Node.js stuff, more over around [Redis](https://redis.com/) and [Event-Driven-Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture).

If you are ever willing to make those subjects step forward in the Open-source community, ping me for collaboration, most of my work is Public!

Here is the list of frameworks I'm mostly using :
  - [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/)
  - [Koa](https://koajs.com/)

Currently, I'm more into low-scope frameworks but here is a list of high-scope frameworks I'm taking interest in.
  - [Platformatic](https://platformatic.dev/)
  - [Nest](https://nestjs.com/)
  - [Adonis](https://adonisjs.com/)
